Earlier, I worked as a Reaearch Assistant in the same lab for 4 months.

My PhD is sponsored by [D-Real SFI CRT](https://d-real.ie/) scholarship and industry partner [Xperi Corpotation](https://Xperi.com). 
 
Prior to that, I have completed my Masters in Data Analytics from [School of Computer Science](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science-engineering/school-of-computer-science/) at the University of Galway. During my masters dissertation I have worked on Combining Enternal Knowledege in atext Classification Task under supervision of [Dr.Matthias Nickles](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/engineering-and-informatics/matthiasnickles/).
